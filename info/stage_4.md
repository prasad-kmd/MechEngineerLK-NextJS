### Stage 4 Prompt: Home, About, Services, and Contact Pages


> Implement the **Home, About, Services, and Contact pages** for the existing Next.js 16 + Tailwind project without re-initializing or altering file structure.  
> 
> - **Home (Hero Section):**
>   - Hero section with name, title (“Mechanical Engineer”), brief value proposition.  
>   - CTA buttons: “View Projects” and “Read Articles.”  
>   - Background treatment: gradient + abstract geometry hinting at mechanics (arcs, stress lines, mesh).  
>   - Stats band: years of experience, publications, projects, certifications.  
>   - Featured content carousels: highlighted public projects and latest blog/articles.  
> 
> - **About Page:**
>   - Biography and skills (materials, CAD/CAE, thermodynamics, control systems).  
>   - Tools (MATLAB, Simulink, SolidWorks, ANSYS).  
>   - Timeline of education and milestones.  
>   - Downloadable CV button.  
>   - Badges for certifications.  
> 
> - **Services Page:**
>   - Cards for consulting, design & simulation, prototyping, data analysis & visualization, documentation.  
>   - Each card includes icon, description, pricing note (“on request”), and CTA to contact.  
> 
> - **Contact Page:**
>   - Contact details but no form  
>   - Social links and location snippet. 
> 
> - **Design Requirements:**
>   - Use shadcn UI components styled with Tailwind.  
>   - Apply brand-fusion design (subtle gradients, soft shadows, backdrop blur).  
>   - Respect dark/light theme toggle.  
>   - Ensure accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus states.  
> 
> Acceptance criteria:  
> - Hero section visually striking but performant (optimized images, CSS-only effects where possible).  
> - Pages responsive and accessible and provide clear feedback.  
> - CTAs navigate correctly to relevant sections.  
> - About and Services pages highlight professional profile and offerings elegantly.
